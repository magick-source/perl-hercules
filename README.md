# Hercules - the distributed cron runner

In classic Greek Mythology Hercules had twelve jobs to do - but twelve
jobs are not that much for this Hercules - this is not one of the childs
of Zeus, but have the power of parallel computing, which allow him to
do, not only twelves jobs, just like the greek hero, but do them at the
same time - It is not even limited at twelve, it can do as many as
you may need it to do, as long as you give him the CPUs to do it.
